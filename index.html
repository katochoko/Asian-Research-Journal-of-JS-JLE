  <h2>About the Journal</h2>
  <p>
    This journal is an academic publication aimed at supporting the research activities of scholars worldwide who focus on Japanese studies and Japanese language education in Asia, and disseminating their findings to the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our primary objective is to serve as a "stepping stone" for researchers aiming for high-standard international academic journals, improving the quality of research through the publication process and contributing to the future career development of contributors.
  </p>
  <p>
    This journal particularly welcomes submissions from early-career researchers and graduate students engaged in Japanese and Asian studies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The journal publishes original research in the fields of Japanese Studies and Japanese Language Education, primarily focusing on East Asia (including Japan) and Southeast Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recognizing that Japanese Studies and Japanese Language Education are inextricably linked in both academic and institutional contexts outside of Japan, this journal provides a platform for integrating insights from both fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    By covering both areas, we aim to stimulate exchange between researchers, creating new perspectives and advancing academic development regarding "Japan."
